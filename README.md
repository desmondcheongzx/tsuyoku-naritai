# tsuyoku-naritai

Tsuyoku naritai means "I want to become stronger" [1]. This is a project to become stronger by learning in public.

The current plan is to do so by working through papers/technical blogs/projects and document my learning process in public. Because of the nature of this, much of the ideas in this repository come from other public sources which I will cite.

[1]: The name of this project was inspired by [Eliezer Yudkowsky's blog post with the same name](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoLQN5ryZ9XkZjq5h/tsuyoku-naritai-i-want-to-become-stronger). I liked the way this phrase rolled off my tongue, however this concept is not new to me. [My own website](https://www.desmondcheong.com) has for years featured the words 自强不息 (zì qiáng bù xī): improve oneself tirelessly, or more literally, self-strengthening without rest. I want to become stronger. This is the echo that has stuck with me my whole life.
